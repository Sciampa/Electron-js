# @electron/contracts

```sh
yarn add @electron/contracts
```

## Electron Protocol TypeScript Bundle

### Clients

All contracts are scoped under the `contracts` object:

```js
import { contracts } from "@electron/contracts"
const { ElectronNativePrediction } = contracts
```

Then each contract will have clients, for example for `ElectronNativePrediction`:

```ts
const {
	ElectronNativePredictionClient,
	ElectronNativePredictionMessageComposer,
	ElectronNativePredictionQueryClient
} = ElectronNativePrediction
```
